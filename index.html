                “ I am Aashish Sapkota, a student of grade X. I am passionate about music since my childhood because of my brother. I enjoyed listening and singing songs. Slowly and gradually, I started playing instruments. I like the piano the most and enjoy playing this instrument. I learned the keyboard online. I faced many problems while learning the keyboard as I didn't even have a good keyboard and no one was there personally to teach me. But my parents supported me a lot. They managed a good keyboard for me and different books for learning piano as well. They have always been the source of motivation to me. Their support and encouragement always makes me believe that I can move forward and achieve my dreams . “
